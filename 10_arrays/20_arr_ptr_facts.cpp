// lets some extra facts about character array and pointers.

// char *ptr="abc"; what happens "abc", will be in read-only memory. and this ptr will point there.
// and u cant modify this abc, since it is in read-only memory, but u can read.

// where as char arr[]="abc", this is stored as a, b, c, \O as in write/read memory.
// so we can modify here.
