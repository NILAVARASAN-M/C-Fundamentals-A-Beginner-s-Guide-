// capacity help in maintaing the storage and contents of the dynamic array in c++ -> vector.

/*
1.) size() – Returns the number of elements in the vector.
2.) max_size() – Returns the maximum number of elements that
 the vector can hold.
3.) capacity() – Returns the size of the storage space currently allocated
 to the vector expressed as number of elements.
4.) resize(n) – Resizes the container so that it contains ‘n’ elements.
5.) empty() – Returns whether the container is empty.
6.) shrink_to_fit() – Reduces the capacity of the container to fit its 
size and destroys all elements beyond the capacity.
7.) reserve() – Requests that the vector capacity be at least enough to contain n elements.
