// vector::resize()
// The function alters the containerâ€™s content in actual by inserting or deleting the elements from it. It happens so,

// If the given value of n is less than the size at present then extra elements are demolished.
// If n is more than current size of container then upcoming elements are appended at the end of the vector.

// case-1 when Size of the vector container is lowered.
