It reads a stream of characters of length N into the string buffer, It stops when it has read (N â€“ 1) 
characters or it finds the end of the file or newline character(\n). Below is the C++ program to 
implement cin.getline():

The `cin.getline()` function in C++ is used to read a line of text from the standard input (usually the keyboard) and store it in a character array (`buffer`). Here's a breakdown of its syntax and functionality:

1. **Syntax**:
   ```cpp
   cin.getline(char *buffer, int N);
   ```

2. **Parameters**:
   - `buffer`: A pointer to a character array where the input will be stored. It should have enough space to accommodate the input text, including the null terminator ('\0').
   - `N`: An integer specifying the maximum number of characters to read, including the null terminator. This helps prevent buffer overflow by limiting the number of characters read.

3. **Functionality**:
   - The `cin.getline()` function reads characters from the standard input (usually the keyboard) until one of the following conditions is met:
     - A newline character ('\n') is encountered.
     - `N - 1` characters have been read.
     - The end-of-file (EOF) condition is reached (e.g., if reading from a file).
   - The newline character ('\n') is also read from the input stream but is not stored in the buffer. Instead, it is replaced with a null terminator ('\0') to terminate the string.
   - After reading the input line, `cin.getline()` stores the characters in the provided `buffer` and adds a null terminator ('\0') to the end to signify the end of the string.
   - If the input line is longer than `N - 1` characters, `cin.getline()` reads only `N - 1` characters from the input stream and discards the remaining characters, effectively truncating the input to fit within the specified buffer size.
   - If the input stream encounters an error or reaches the end-of-file (EOF) condition before reading any characters, `cin.getline()` sets the failbit of the `cin` stream.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The `cin.getline()` function returns a reference to the `cin` stream object, allowing for chaining of input operations.

In summary, `cin.getline()` is a versatile function for reading lines of text from the standard input, ensuring that the input does not exceed the specified buffer size and providing safeguards against buffer overflow.

/*
note there are two type of getline():

1.) cin.getline(char *ptr, size):
this is one type, here only char can be passed, that is a pointer is only allowed. nd string is also not allowed
2.) getline(cin, string):
in here only string can be passed, and char array cannot be passed.
