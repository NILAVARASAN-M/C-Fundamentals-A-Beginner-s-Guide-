/*
Initializing member variables in the constructor initializer list is preferred in C++ for several reasons:

1. **Efficiency**: Initialization in the constructor initializer list directly initializes the member variable, which can be more efficient, especially for non-trivial types like classes or arrays. This avoids the default initialization followed by assignment that occurs when initializing in the constructor body.

2. **Const and Reference Members**: For `const` and reference member variables, initialization in the constructor initializer list is mandatory because these types cannot be assigned to after they are initialized.

3. **Initialization Order**: Member variables are initialized in the order they are declared in the class, regardless of the order in which they appear in the constructor initializer list. Initializing in the constructor initializer list ensures control over the initialization order, which can prevent potential issues related to initialization dependencies.

4. **Compiler Warnings**: Some compilers may issue warnings if member variables are initialized in the constructor body rather than in the constructor initializer list, especially if the variables are `const` or reference types.

Overall, initializing member variables in the constructor initializer list promotes efficiency, clarity, and correctness in C++ code.
