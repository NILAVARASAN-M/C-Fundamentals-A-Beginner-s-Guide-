/*
Certainly! Let's break down the line `vector<int>::iterator p`:

1. `vector<int>`: This specifies the type of the container. In this case, it's a vector containing integers.

2. `::`: This is the scope resolution operator. It's used to access members or types defined within a class or namespace.

3. `iterator`: This is the nested type defined within the `vector<int>` class. It represents an iterator that 
can be used to traverse the elements of the vector.

4. `p`: This is the name of the variable being declared. It's of type `vector<int>::iterator`, meaning it's an 
iterator that can iterate over the elements of a vector containing integers.

So, `vector<int>::iterator p` declares a variable named `p` that can be used to traverse the elements of a vector
of integers. It's important to note that `vector<int>::iterator` is a specific type provided by the `std::vector` 
container class in C++. It's used to iterate over the elements of the vector and perform operations like traversal, insertion, and deletion.
*/

// so each element in an vector is called as iterator ???

/*
Not quite. Each element in a vector is not called an iterator. An iterator is an object that provides a way to 
traverse the elements of a container, such as a vector, sequentially. It acts as a pointer to elements in the container, 
allowing you to access, modify, and iterate over the elements.

In the example I provided, `iter` is an iterator variable that points to the elements of the vector `numbers`. By using 
`*iter`, we can access the element that `iter` is currently pointing to. 

So, an iterator is like a tool that helps you navigate through the elements of a container, but it's not the elements 
themselves. It's more accurate to say that an iterator points to the elements of the container.
*/

// in short iterator will point to the elements in the vector, we can use accordingly then.
// code for example sake.

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
    // Create a vector of integers
    std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Declare an iterator to traverse the vector
    std::vector<int>::iterator iter;

    // Initialize the iterator to point to the beginning of the vector
    iter = numbers.begin();

    // Print the elements of the vector using the iterator
    std::cout << "Elements of the vector: ";
    while (iter != numbers.end()) {
        std::cout << *iter << " "; // Dereference the iterator to get the element
        ++iter; // Move the iterator to the next element
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
