/*
There are two most popular ways to pass parameters:

Pass by Value: 
In this parameter passing method, values of actual parameters are copied to the
functionâ€™s formal parameters. The actual and formal parameters are stored in different memory locations
so any changes made in the functions are not reflected in the actual parameters of the caller. 
 
Pass by Reference:
Both actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations, so any changes made inside 
the function are reflected in the actual parameters of the caller.
*/

// this pass by value  can be also called as --> call by value.
// this pass by refrence  can be also called as --> call by refrence.

// another way of declaring an void function, with the parameters also void is
void fun1(){}
void fun2(void){}
