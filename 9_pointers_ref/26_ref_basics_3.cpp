// int& -> this is refrence, but they dont have an seperate location in memory, so u cant have a pointer pointing to an refrence varaible.
/*
In C++, you cannot have a pointer to a reference. References are essentially aliases for existing objects, and they do not have separate memory addresses like pointers do. Therefore, attempting to create a pointer to a reference (`int&* ptr1 = ptr;`) is not allowed and will result in a compilation error.

If you need to store the address of an object pointed to by a pointer, you can directly assign the pointer to another pointer of the same type. For example:

```cpp
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x;
int* ptr1 = ptr; // Assigning the address stored in ptr to ptr1
```

But you cannot create a pointer to a reference, as references themselves do not have addresses.

// but u said that * has more precedence then & ??
/*
You're correct; I misspoke. The precedence of the unary `*` operator (dereference operator) is indeed higher than the unary `&` operator (address-of operator).

However, in the expression `int&* ptr1 = ptr;`, the `&` operator is being used as part of the declaration syntax for creating a reference. This usage is not for obtaining the address of an object but rather for declaring a reference variable. In this context, the `&` operator is not the address-of operator but part of the syntax for creating a reference.

So, in this case, the precedence rules regarding `*` and `&` are not directly relevant. Instead, the issue is with the syntax of trying to declare a pointer to a reference, which is not valid in C++.
*/

// i cant understand why precedence can be applied here.
/*

You're correct, precedence doesn't apply directly in this context because we're dealing with the declaration syntax of C++, not an expression involving operators.

In C++, the `&` symbol can have two different meanings:

1. As the address-of operator, used to get the memory address of a variable.
2. As part of the declaration syntax, used to declare a reference variable.

When `&` is used in a declaration like `int&`, it indicates that the variable being declared is a reference to an `int`. Similarly, when `*` is used in a declaration like `int*`, it indicates that the variable being declared is a pointer to an `int`.

So, when we see `int&* ptr1`, it's attempting to declare a pointer to a reference to an `int`, which is not valid syntax in C++. That's why this line of code will result in a compilation error. The precedence of `*` and `&` operators doesn't come into play here; rather, it's a matter of the grammar rules for variable declarations in C++.

//then explain where precedence can be applied and where it cannot be applied??

/*
Precedence is a concept that governs the order in which operators are evaluated within expressions. It defines 
which operators are evaluated first when multiple operators appear together in an expression. Precedence is applicable
 to expressions involving operators, such as arithmetic expressions, logical expressions, and assignment expressions.

Precedence is not applicable to other language constructs, such as variable declarations, function definitions, or control
 flow statements. These constructs follow specific syntax rules defined by the language grammar, and the order in which parts 
 of these constructs are evaluated or interpreted is not determined by precedence rules.

To summarize:

1. Precedence applies to expressions involving operators, determining the order of evaluation within the expression.
2. Precedence does not apply to language constructs like variable declarations, function definitions, or control flow statements, 
as these follow specific syntax rules defined by the language grammar.
3. In contexts where precedence is not applicable, syntax rules dictate the structure and interpretation of the language constructs.
