// Deque is similar to queue, stack etc. In dequeue we can perform stack operations as well as queue, operations.
// so We can implement stack and queue using, dequeue only.
// we can insert elements at the front and rear, similarly we can delete elements at the front and rear, also

// so this dequeue has all the, every function that the vector has the dequeue also has. The dequeue also has all the functions.

// begin(), end(), rbegin(), rend(), cbegin(), cend(), crbegin(), crend(), assign(), at(), insert(), emplace(), clear(), erase(), remove 
// .... similarly all the functions in vectoris also available in this dequeue.

// SO what makes the difference is that

// 1.) there are some additional functions, which are not there is the vectors.
// - push_back(), push_front().
// - pop_front(), pop_back().
// - front(), back().
// clear(), erase().
// size(), empty().
// emplace_front(), emplace_back().

// this are the additinal functions, but yeah in this half are there in vector only. The above functions are the standard
// functions that should be there for any dequeu data-struct's.
